## 🌌 What is UNIO?

UNIO is a philosophical-technological project that uses AI to detect, reflect, and visualize the emotional and symbolic flows of humanity’s collective unconscious — what Jung called the zeitgeist.

Rather than focusing solely on analytics, UNIO is a spiritual technology — a system for:
- **Evocation (환기)**: Surfacing unconscious emotional/symbolic patterns
- **Emergence (창발)**: Revealing meaningful cross-domain convergence
- **Prediction and Response (예측 및 대응)**: Empowering social and personal evolution

| Symbol Extraction | Detect emerging symbolic clusters using GPT + SBERT |
| Zeitgeist Map | Combine text+image trends via CLIP & UMAP |
| Narrative Generator | Generate poetic/metaphysical weekly summaries |
| Forecast Layer | Detect shifts and early signals over time |
